        <p>I have decided to write a blog so I can forever remember and look back on these insane, unprecedented times. We have been social distancing for about 2 weeks now, which means that schools are shut down and we are encouraged to stay home. This week, the U.S. topped China in total deaths due to COVID-19, and they have put areas that have cases under shelter in place, which means that it is illegal to leave your house for any reason other than to get neccesities. Spring break was right before social distancing started, which means that we have been stuck at home for 3 weeks with nothing to do, and with no end in sight. This week our teachers started sharing assignments on Google Classroom so that we could continue our education at home, but it's not too bad. Even with all the craziness going on, my weekday's are pretty structured. I wake up around 9:30, check all my notifications, eat breakfast, and then me, Mom, Bryn, and Ally walk the dogs up and down the driveway while listening to our daily devotional. After that I usually do my school work on the computer - which takes about an hour - and then we head to the elementary school where they hand out free lunches Monday through Thursday. I normally spend my afternoons by learning computer progamming (which is how I learned to do this), riding my bike, reading, shooting baskets on my nerf basketball goal, playing Xbox, playing mancala with the girls, etc. We have started going up to the courts to hit, and after we are done, Mom lets us drive around the parking lot. At night we normally watch TV as a family, and then me and Mom watch about 4 episodes of The Office when everyone else goes to bed, although she normally falls asleep midway through the first episode. I then wake up, and repeat it all over again. I'm not bored that often, but occasionally I am. I enjoy living like this, but it can get repetitive sometimes. Wow, I think this is enough for the first day. I look forward to writing tomorrow.<br>

        Today was a very relaxing day. I slept in, and we didn't really do all that much. I spent the majority of the day reading, playing backgammon with Mom, and shooting baskets in my mini nerf basketball goal. The only productive thing I did today was help move around our couch and furniture in the living room to make room for the grand piano that Nawnee and Poppy are giving us since they are renting out their house and don't have a place to keep it. I'm looking forward to continuing to learn the piano and to learn some more complex songs in the future.  I just finished eating dinner, and we are about to start watching some TV. Today was a great day.

        Today was pretty similar to yesterday; uneventful. I woke up around a normal time and ate some cereal. Then, we walked the driveway and listened to our devotional. After that, me and my mom attempted to find an old horseshoes kit that was was buried somewhere in the backyard using our metal detector. Suprisingly, we found it after about 30 minutes of searching and digging. We were inspired by our find, and after we ate lunch, we decided to search for the water valve which has been hidden and unsuccessfully searched for in the trap. Unfortunately, we did not find it. I spent the rest of the day playing Xbox, reading, and playing backgammon with Ally and my Mom. I just finished eating dinner, and I am looking forward to watching our new show that we watch, Opal Hunters, which I am sure Ally talked about, and The Office tonight. Another enjoyable, yet mundane weekend.

        I started off today by eating breakfast and then listening to our daily devotional on the couch with Mom, Bryn, and Ally. Then, we walked the dogs up and down the driveway a couple of times, and afterwards I read a little bit of my book. The next thing we did was head over to the middle school to pick up this weeks schoolwork, and then to the elementary for our lunch. Today's lunch was not very good, but they always give us cereal for the next day's breakfast, so I ate that instead, and it was delicous. Our teachers gave us a whole bunch more work this week than they did last week so I spent most of the afternoon doing my schoolwork. Most of the time it took so long was because our BCIS teacher gave us a big packet of Excel spreadsheets and Word documents to make, and it took forever to finish that. Fortunately, I had a little bit of time left over to ride my bike and play backgammon with Ally. Before I knew it, my Dad was home and it was time for dinner. Today had it's high's and it's lows, but ultimately it was a good day, even if it went by very fast.

        Today started off with a bang. We purchased 4 fainting goats about a week ago, and today they were being delivered to us when I woke up. We got 2 pregnant does and 2 young kids, and the 2 does will give both give birth in about a month. A kid is a young goat and a doe is a mature female. I have wanted to get fainting goats for a long time, and I'm really excited that we finally have some. We spent about an hour running at them and making them faint after the people who delivered them left, and it is hilarious when they faint! At first when you run at them, their back legs stiffen up, and they just kinda hobble around in an extremely amusing way. Then, when you get closer, they suddenly fall over, and don't move at all. It would actually seem like their dead, except that they bleat very loudly while they're laying on the ground I hope that we are able to breed them multiple times so that we eventually have a large herd. We decided that we will all get to name on of the goats. One of the does was named Peewee, so we decided to keep that name, and Bryn named the other Doe Sandy because she has light brown hair. One of the kids is black and white, so Ally named her Oreo. The other kid is brown and white, but my mom hasn't decided what to name her yet. I am going to name one of the babies that the does are pregnant with, and my Dad will name the other. After we finished playing with them, I quickly finished up my schoolwork. I didn't have very much scoolwork today since I did so much yesterday, and I finished before lunch. After lunch my mom left for College Station, and me and my sisters had an enormous nerf gun battle. We put chairs, pillows, and blankets all over the house, creating a mess. It was worth it though, because it was a blast. We played until she got back, and then we had to pick it all up. We wanted to go on a bike ride through town, but our tires were flat, so we had to replace the inner tubes. None of us had ever replaced bike inner tubes before, so it was definitely a struggle. It was way more difficult than I thought it would be, but we got it done after about an hour. When we finished, we rode our bikes through town, and it was a blast. When we got back, we hung out a bit, and then my dad was home. He brought feed, a water trough, and hay shavings for the goats, so we spent some time setting up their pens and setting up the feeding situation. After we got their pens set up, we planted the garden. We planted 5 rows of black eyed peas, 2 rows of okra, half a row of kale, half a row of swiss chard, and some pumkins, watermelon, and tomatoes in another spot. We should have lots of produce in a couple of month, so if the world ends, at least we won't die of starvation. By the time we finished planting, the sun had just set. We ate dinner, which was delicious, and me, Bryn, Ally, and my Dad are about to play nerf basketball in my room. Today was a very eventful day, and I really look forward to tomorrow.

        Today was a pretty monotonous day, but it had its moments. We started off the day well by listening to our bible study over breakfast and then walking the dogs down the driveway. The rest of the morning was spent finishing up my schoolwork for the week and re-reading the Hunger Games. Even though I have already read it, it is thouroughly engrossing. It is an amazing book. After lunch, which was pizza rolls from Double Daves, me and Bryn rode our bikes down to the drainage ditch near the road to hunt for crawfish. Our method is to poke a pole in the shrubbery around the bank and then slam a cup on top of them when they dart out. We hunted for about thirty minutes, caught three of them, and then brought them back. After we got back, I read a little bit more, and then me and Bryn had another nerf fight, but without all the obstacles. It was very intense and physically taxing. After I defeated her a couple of times, my mom asked us to get rid of some old eggs. This doesn't happen very often, and it is always the highlight of my day when it does happen. It basically means that she hands us an enormously large bag of eggs, and we walk to the back and chunk them at whatever we please. It is thrilling and we always have a blast; nothing compares to it. After we finished cleaning ourselves up afterwards, we got some popsicles, sat on the porch, and just relaxed. The tranquility outside was very relaxing. I spent the rest of the evening reading and spending time with my family. After looking back, I guess it wasn't as monotonous as I had thought it was. I look forward to tomorrow's adventures.

        Today was extremely unwinding. I didn't do much other than read and listen to our bible study in the morning, and before I knew it it was midday. Around noon, we headed up to the school to pick up our free lunch for today and tomorrow, since they don't serve lunches on Friday's. The lunch was actually pretty good today. After lunch, we walked up and down the driveway and tried to catch more crawfish, but without any luck. When we got back, we all played a thrilling game of ticket to ride. It was extremely close, and Ally barely beat all of us by just a couple of points. Right after we finished, I saw a pure white cat outside the window, so we went to go check it out. It was pretty friendly to us, but he chased after our other cats, so we shooed him away. Afterwards, we got some popsicles from the fridge and sat on the porch again. Once again, it was exteremely calming. After we finished, there wasn't much time left before my dad came home, so I read my book some more. When my dad came home, we all hung out and then ate dinner. I had a blast today, and I'm not really sure why, because it was very similar to the last couple of weeks. Maybe I'm just starting to embrace this lifestyle. I hope I enjoy tomorrow just as much as I did today.

        Today was a fairly productive day. I woke up, ate some breakfast, and then we went on our walk and listened to our bible study. Today we learned about one of my favorite bible stories; the 10 plagues. I think it's so cool because it is one of the only places in the bible that God gives us a glimpse in to the amount of power that he really holds. Afterwards, I ate lunch and finished up my schoolwork for the week, which was a breeze. When I finished, we cleaned, vacuumed, and dusted our rooms, which actually felt pretty good because my room has been such a mess lately. It also felt good to be doing something for once. After I finished tidying up my room, It was reasonably late in the day, so I pretty much just read until my dad came home. I am at the end of Catching Fire, which is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy. It is by far my favorite book in the series, and one of my favorite books of all time. It is truly captivating. By the time I had come back to the real world, my dad was home and it was time to eat dinner. Tonight I will probably finish up my book and watch the office. Today was a great day.

        Today was a very cozy day. It was raining pretty hard outside, and it was very cold, so we pretty much just curled up with blankets all day inside. I woke up, ate breakfast, and then we sat on the couch, talked, and had our bible study for about an hour. After that, we headed out to the gameroom to work on a puzzle for another hour. It was very warm and comfortable in there because we turned on the heater and brought a bunch of blankets. It was an excellent way to start the day. After lunch, we all played a game of ticket to ride as a family. It was a very close game, and my dad ended up edging out my mom by just a couple of points. It was a blast. When we finished cleaning up, we went back out and tried to get some more progress on the puzzle, but without any luck. It is a 3-D model of a castle, with around 900 pieces, so it is very difficult. When we tired of staring at identical pieces, we came back inside and just chilled on the couch for a little bit. It was soooo comforting. Afterwards, we ate dinner and then watched a movie called National Treasures. It was very interesting and was about a group of treasure hunters finding a long lost treasure. When the movie ended, the girls went to bed because it was late, but me and my parents stayed up and watched another movie; The Hunger Games. It was thrilling and one of the best movies I have ever watched. Ever since I read the books, I have been wanting to watch the movies, and I finally got to watch one. I am looking forward to watching the others, which I will probably watch next weekend. Overall today was an amazing day, and I hope tomorrow will be similar inn every way possible.

        Today was not quite as cozy as yesterday, but still very relaxing. I woke up and had breakfast, which was delicious because my Mom surprised us with pancakes, and shortly thereafter we had our bible study. After bible study, me and Ally came up with a marvelous new idea for nerf battles. We each would get a pistol loaded with bullets and some bullets in our pocket. Then, we would have our backs touching, and each slowly take three steps. Next, we would turn around, quickly fire, and if no one got hit, then we would dive for cover. After that it was a free-for-all, and whoever got hit first lost. It was extremely enjoyable, and we had many more "duels", as we called it. Soon, it was time for lunch, which was delectable tortellini. Afterwards, me and my Mom played some games of backgammon, which I won, and I read some of my book I'm on, the final Hunger Games book. I spent most of the rest of the afternoon reading my book and a little bit playing my Xbox. The afternoon flew while I was reading, and before I knew it, it was around dinner time. My dad grilled steaks and we also had mashed potatoes and salad. It was delicious! This is one of my favorite dinners, but we normally only eat it every once and a while. We are going to watch Night at the Museum tonight, which I am really excited to watch because I have seen it before and I remember it being hilarious, but I don't remember what it is about. Today has been wonderful, and I am looking forward to tommorrow.

        Today was a pretty efficient day, and I got a lot done. My mom had gone to a dermatologist in College Station, so we were pretty much alone at the house the whole morning. Right after I woke up, me and Bryn had to go outside to feed the goats. One of our yound goats has scours, which is basically diahrrea, so we also had to give it some medicine. When we finished, we ate some powdered donuts for breakfast and did all our chores. Then, I got started on my schoolwork, which took all morning. When my mom got back, it was around lunchtime, we had delicious hotdogs while we listened to our biblle study. After lunch, I finished reading the Hunger Games which had an outstanding ending. Then, me and Bryn made a huge batch of buffalo chip cookies! I have actually never made cookies before, and this was a great first experience. It was a whole lot easier to follow instructions than I thought it would be, and also didn't take as long as I thought it would. I really enjoyed it, and it was worth it, because they were delicious. Afterwards, I played mini basketball a little bit and played some of my Xbox. The afternoon flew by, and soon it was time to eat dinner. Tonight we are going to watch another movie, and though I am not sure which one, I look forward to it. Today was not one of the more enjoyable or fun days that I have had during quarantine, but I got much done, and I felt very productive. I am looking forward to tomorrow.

        Today was another very productive day. I started today off by eating breakfast and then walking up and down the driveway with Bryn, Ally, Mom, and the dogs while listening to our bible study. I then began reading a new series, which is another series that was written by Suzanne Collins, who wrote the Hunger Games. After reading for just a little bit, I started on my schoolwork. I had tons of schoolwork today, and I still hadn't finished all of it. We had crisp grilled cheeses for lunch, and when we finished, we had to head up to the ag barn to collect all our supplies. I didn't think it would be much, but by the time we loaded it all up in the truck, we had almost no room left in the truck. We then headed back and stored it all in our shed for next year. It was very hot outside, and with all the heavy carrying of feedbags and such, I was very sweaty by the end of it. After showering, I read my book and played my Xbox for a couple of hours while waiting for the girls to finish up their schoolwork. By the time they finished, it was late afternoon, and when I finished, my dad was going to be home soon. I read a little bit more of my book, which is very interesting, and played some games of masterminds with Ally. Masterminds is an extremely neat and clever game in which one person makes a code and the other has to break the code. The codemaker makes the code by placing 4 colored pegs in a unique order in holes hidden from the codebreaker. The codebreaker then has 10 attempts to guess it by placing 4 colored pegs in holes in the of the color and order that he suspects them to be in. The codemaker then places white and black smaller pegs to the side of the guess that give the codemaker clues. It is normally fairly easy to guess it in 10 tries using the clues, but it requires a whole bunch of thinking. It is very easy to learn, but extremely difficult to master. By the time, me and Ally finished playing a couple rounds, my dad was home and it was time to eat dinner, which was delicious lasagna. After dinner, I started learning Spanish on my phone using an app called Duolingo. It is an incredible app, and it makes learning languages enjoyable. I plan on spending about half an hour every day learning Spanish, which shouldn't be impossible. After about half an hour, we started watching TV. It has been a pretty productive day, but not very enjoyable, even though it had it's moments. Overall, it has been very similar to yesterday. The rest of the week is looking better though, because I am almost through with my schoolwork for this week. I look forward to whatever tomorrow holds.
