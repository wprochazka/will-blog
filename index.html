        <p>I have decided to write a blog so I can forever remember and look back on these insane, unprecedented times. We have been social distancing for about 2 weeks now, which means that schools are shut down and we are encouraged to stay home. This week, the U.S. topped China in total deaths due to COVID-19, and they have put areas that have cases under shelter in place, which means that it is illegal to leave your house for any reason other than to get neccesities. Spring break was right before social distancing started, which means that we have been stuck at home for 3 weeks with nothing to do, and with no end in sight. This week our teachers started sharing assignments on Google Classroom so that we could continue our education at home, but it's not too bad. Even with all the craziness going on, my weekday's are pretty structured. I wake up around 9:30, check all my notifications, eat breakfast, and then me, Mom, Bryn, and Ally walk the dogs up and down the driveway while listening to our daily devotional. After that I usually do my school work on the computer - which takes about an hour - and then we head to the elementary school where they hand out free lunches Monday through Thursday. I normally spend my afternoons by learning computer progamming (which is how I learned to do this), riding my bike, reading, shooting baskets on my nerf basketball goal, playing Xbox, playing mancala with the girls, etc. We have started going up to the courts to hit, and after we are done, Mom lets us drive around the parking lot. At night we normally watch TV as a family, and then me and Mom watch about 4 episodes of The Office when everyone else goes to bed, although she normally falls asleep midway through the first episode. I then wake up, and repeat it all over again. I'm not bored that often, but occasionally I am. I enjoy living like this, but it can get repetitive sometimes. Wow, I think this is enough for the first day. I look forward to writing tomorrow.<br>

        Today was a very relaxing day. I slept in, and we didn't really do all that much. I spent the majority of the day reading, playing backgammon with Mom, and shooting baskets in my mini nerf basketball goal. The only productive thing I did today was help move around our couch and furniture in the living room to make room for the grand piano that Nawnee and Poppy are giving us since they are renting out their house and don't have a place to keep it. I'm looking forward to continuing to learn the piano and to learn some more complex songs in the future.  I just finished eating dinner, and we are about to start watching some TV. Today was a great day.

        Today was pretty similar to yesterday; uneventful. I woke up around a normal time and ate some cereal. Then, we walked the driveway and listened to our devotional. After that, me and my mom attempted to find an old horseshoes kit that was was buried somewhere in the backyard using our metal detector. Suprisingly, we found it after about 30 minutes of searching and digging. We were inspired by our find, and after we ate lunch, we decided to search for the water valve which has been hidden and unsuccessfully searched for in the trap. Unfortunately, we did not find it. I spent the rest of the day playing Xbox, reading, and playing backgammon with Ally and my Mom. I just finished eating dinner, and I am looking forward to watching our new show that we watch, Opal Hunters, which I am sure Ally talked about, and The Office tonight. Another enjoyable, yet mundane weekend.

        I started off today by eating breakfast and then listening to our daily devotional on the couch with Mom, Bryn, and Ally. Then, we walked the dogs up and down the driveway a couple of times, and afterwards I read a little bit of my book. The next thing we did was head over to the middle school to pick up this weeks schoolwork, and then to the elementary for our lunch. Today's lunch was not very good, but they always give us cereal for the next day's breakfast, so I ate that instead, and it was delicous. Our teachers gave us a whole bunch more work this week than they did last week so I spent most of the afternoon doing my schoolwork. Most of the time it took so long was because our BCIS teacher gave us a big packet of Excel spreadsheets and Word documents to make, and it took forever to finish that. Fortunately, I had a little bit of time left over to ride my bike and play backgammon with Ally. Before I knew it, my Dad was home and it was time for dinner. Today had it's high's and it's lows, but ultimately it was a good day, even if it went by very fast.

        Today started off with a bang. We purchased 4 fainting goats about a week ago, and today they were being delivered to us when I woke up. We got 2 pregnant does and 2 young kids, and the 2 does will give both give birth in about a month. A kid is a young goat and a doe is a mature female. I have wanted to get fainting goats for a long time, and I'm really excited that we finally have some. We spent about an hour running at them and making them faint after the people who delivered them left, and it is hilarious when they faint! At first when you run at them, their back legs stiffen up, and they just kinda hobble around in an extremely amusing way. Then, when you get closer, they suddenly fall over, and don't move at all. It would actually seem like their dead, except that they bleat very loudly while they're laying on the ground I hope that we are able to breed them multiple times so that we eventually have a large herd. We decided that we will all get to name on of the goats. One of the does was named Peewee, so we decided to keep that name, and Bryn named the other Doe Sandy because she has light brown hair. One of the kids is black and white, so Ally named her Oreo. The other kid is brown and white, but my mom hasn't decided what to name her yet. I am going to name one of the babies that the does are pregnant with, and my Dad will name the other. After we finished playing with them, I quickly finished up my schoolwork. I didn't have very much scoolwork today since I did so much yesterday, and I finished before lunch. After lunch my mom left for College Station, and me and my sisters had an enormous nerf gun battle. We put chairs, pillows, and blankets all over the house, creating a mess. It was worth it though, because it was a blast. We played until she got back, and then we had to pick it all up. We wanted to go on a bike ride through town, but our tires were flat, so we had to replace the inner tubes. None of us had ever replaced bike inner tubes before, so it was definitely a struggle. It was way more difficult than I thought it would be, but we got it done after about an hour. When we finished, we rode our bikes through town, and it was a blast. When we got back, we hung out a bit, and then my dad was home. He brought feed, a water trough, and hay shavings for the goats, so we spent some time setting up their pens and setting up the feeding situation. After we got their pens set up, we planted the garden. We planted 5 rows of black eyed peas, 2 rows of okra, half a row of kale, half a row of swiss chard, and some pumkins, watermelon, and tomatoes in another spot. We should have lots of produce in a couple of month, so if the world ends, at least we won't die of starvation. By the time we finished planting, the sun had just set. We ate dinner, which was delicious, and me, Bryn, Ally, and my Dad are about to play nerf basketball in my room. Today was a very eventful day, and I really look forward to tomorrow.

        Today was a pretty monotonous day, but it had its moments. We started off the day well by listening to our bible study over breakfast and then walking the dogs down the driveway. The rest of the morning was spent finishing up my schoolwork for the week and re-reading the Hunger Games. Even though I have already read it, it is thouroughly engrossing. It is an amazing book. After lunch, which was pizza rolls from Double Daves, me and Bryn rode our bikes down to the drainage ditch near the road to hunt for crawfish. Our method is to poke a pole in the shrubbery around the bank and then slam a cup on top of them when they dart out. We hunted for about thirty minutes, caught three of them, and then brought them back. After we got back, I read a little bit more, and then me and Bryn had another nerf fight, but without all the obstacles. It was very intense and physically taxing. After I defeated her a couple of times, my mom asked us to get rid of some old eggs. This doesn't happen very often, and it is always the highlight of my day when it does happen. It basically means that she hands us an enormously large bag of eggs, and we walk to the back and chunk them at whatever we please. It is thrilling and we always have a blast; nothing compares to it. After we finished cleaning ourselves up afterwards, we got some popsicles, sat on the porch, and just relaxed. The tranquility outside was very relaxing. I spent the rest of the evening reading and spending time with my family. After looking back, I guess it wasn't as monotonous as I had thought it was. I look forward to tomorrow's adventures.
